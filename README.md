# **Age and Gender Detection**  

This repository contains code for training an AI model to **detect age and gender**. A **pre-trained model** with an **accuracy of 97.76%** is already available for use.  

## **Dataset**  
The model was trained using the **UTKFace Dataset**, available on Kaggle:  
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jangedoo/utkface-new)  

## **Technologies Used**  
The project utilizes the following libraries:  
- **NumPy** – For numerical computations  
- **Pandas** – For data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib** – For data visualization  
- **Keras** – For building deep learning models  
- **TensorFlow** – As the backend for Keras  
- **Scikit-learn** – For data preprocessing and model evaluation  

## **Features**  
✅ **age and gender** prediction  
✅ Pre-trained model with **high accuracy (97.76%)**  
✅ Custom training capability using the UTKFace dataset
